#How many quantitative variables are in DDT?

#How many species are in the ddt data set?

#Subset the ddt data set so that we see only the observations with SPECIES,  LMBASS and WEIGHT bigger than 800gms

#Subset the ddt data set so that we see only those observations where the RIVER is SCM   and DDT bigger than 4.0

#Task 4
#Find the mean length of fish in the ddt data frame

#What is the standard deviation of the weight of fish in the ddt data frame?

#Is this the plot of LENGTH vs WEIGHT from the ddt data frame?

#If v=1:20 what is the last value of v/20?

#Task 5
#Make a table of the rivers.

#Make a color coded barplot of the rivers

#Make a table of the rivers crossed with the species of fish

#Make a barplot of the rivers crossed with the species of fish.

#Task 6
#Make a pie chart of Fish SPECIES

#Make a pie chart of RIVERS

#Task 7
#Make a boxplot of the variable DDT

#Make a boxplot of the variable WEIGHT

#Make a boxplot of the variable LENGTH

#Task 8
#Make a coplot of LENGTH Vs WEIGHT given RIVER

#Make a coplot of DDT Vs WEIGHT given SPECIES
